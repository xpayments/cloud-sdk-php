# X-Payments Cloud SDK for PHP 7.x

When processing online credit card payments, X-Payments works as an intermediary between a shopping cart application or any other API-friendly system on one side and payment gateways and 3D-Secure systems on the other side, implementing the PCI compliant secure layer that works with credit card data and keeps your applications and systems out of the PCI scope.
